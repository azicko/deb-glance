    Adds a new function that is called in the
    tasks_get_all function, so that everytime tasks
    lists are called, the function checks if tasks in
    the database have surpassed the expired_at value;
    if that is the case, then it marks the deleted value
    as 1 for all the expired tasks.

other:
  - Tasks are soft deleted, in Glance, a resource can
    be soft deleted in the Database Table, these resources
    still exist in the database. The same thing happens
    with tasks; they are marked as deleted using the
    delete flag in the Tasks table which are not queried
    on the regular list or show call. The tasks are not
    instantly deleted because there may be information
    contained in the task resource that may not be
    available elsewhere(For example, a successful
    import task will eventually result in the creation
    of an image in Glance, and it would be useful to
    know the UUID of this image. Similarly, if the
    import task fails, end user should be given time
    to read the task resource to analyze the error
    message.)
